# Packet Tracer Notes

- Packet tracer is a tool that simulates real networks 
- There are three main functions in packet tracer
	1. You can add devices to your network and connect them with cables and wires
	2. You can select delete inspect label and group components within your network
	3. Manage networks by opening an existing/sample network, saving your current network 
- The physical tab shows what your network would look like in the real world rather than a diagram
