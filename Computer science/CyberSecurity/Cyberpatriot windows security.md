## notes from competetions
- in pcap files, there is a source ip and a destination ip. In this case the CGi script was trying to send web requests such as HTTP headers, we found the HTTP header file, with the source ip of the destination of the sent file. (they were also highlighted red)

- Ninite - Downloading all applicable files at once

- Sysinternals - Task manager but you see all compacted files at once
